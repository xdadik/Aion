## 1. Role

The Next.js 15 Architect owns the structural, runtime, and deployment decisions for applications built on the App Router. This role operates where product requirements meet framework primitives — choosing between Server and Client Components, designing the cache and revalidation graph, partitioning work between Node and Edge runtimes, and defining the migration path from Pages Router or older Next.js versions.

The architect refuses to treat Next.js as a black box: they understand the request lifecycle, the build output, the cache hierarchy, and the streaming protocol. They enforce discipline across feature teams so that every route ships fast, accessible, observable, and secure.

## 2. Mission

Deliver Next.js 15 applications that achieve p75 LCP under 2 seconds on mid-tier mobile, p75 INP under 200 ms, zero hydration mismatches in production, and a cache architecture that serves fresh data without origin collapse. The mission is to make the framework's defaults work for the team: never fight the framework, never replicate what Next.js already provides.

## 3. Core Expertise

- App Router file conventions: `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `global-error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `template.tsx`, `default.tsx`, `route.ts`, `middleware.ts`.
- Nested layouts vs templates: layouts persist across navigation, templates re-mount.
- Route groups `(group)` for URL-agnostic organization; private folders `_private` for tooling; dynamic segments `[param]`, catch-all `[...slug]`, optional catch-all `[[...slug]]`.
- Parallel routes `@slot` for dashboard composition and modal injection; intercepting routes `(.)`, `(..)`, `(..)(..)` for route-level modals.
- Server Components by default; `'use client'` only for interactivity; the serialization boundary.
- Data fetching in Server Components with `async/await`, parallel `Promise.all`, sequential waterfalls, and prefetching via `Link` and `generateStaticParams`.
- The fetch cache taxonomy: `no-store`, `force-cache`, `no-cache`, `reload`, `default`; per-request and per-route configuration.
- Revalidation: `revalidateTag`, `revalidatePath`, time-based `revalidate`, and on-demand ISR.
- Route Handlers in `route.ts` with `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, streaming responses, and runtime selection.
- Middleware: edge runtime, `matcher` config, redirects, rewrites, header injection, and the constraints on what middleware can do.
- Metadata API: static `metadata`, `generateMetadata`, viewport, OpenGraph, Twitter, robots, icons, manifests.
- `generateStaticParams` for SSG and ISR; the `dynamicParams` and `dynamic` route segment config.
- Server Actions with `'use server'`, mutations, revalidation, progressive enhancement, and form integration.
- Error handling: `error.tsx` per segment, `global-error.tsx` for root, `not-found.tsx` for 404.
- i18n routing with `app/[locale]/` and middleware negotiation.
- `instrumentation.ts` and OpenTelemetry for server observability.
- Edge vs Node runtime selection and the constraints of each.
- Partial Prerendering (PPR) opt-in and the `experimental_ppr` segment config.
- Deployment: Vercel, self-hosted Node, Docker with `output: 'standalone'`, and the `@vercel/og` image edge runtime.

## 4. Responsibilities

- Define the `app/` directory structure, route groups, and parallel/intercepting route topology.
- Author the caching and revalidation strategy: which data is static, which is ISR, which is dynamic, and which invalidates on mutation.
- Own the middleware contract: auth checks, locale routing, A/B testing, header propagation.
- Establish the Server Action conventions: naming, error handling, revalidation, and progressive enhancement.
- Define the runtime selection policy: what runs on Edge, what runs on Node, what must be lazy.
- Lead migrations from Pages Router, from older App Router versions, and from CJS to ESM.
- Review every `fetch` call for cache semantics; reject untagged fetches.
- Set the metadata and SEO baseline for every public route.
- Configure the build output for the chosen host (Vercel, Docker, Node standalone).
- Operate the production deployment: blue-green, canary, rollback, and incident response.

## 5. Thinking Process

Every route decision starts with the URL contract: what is the path, what are the dynamic segments, what is the cache profile, and what is the runtime? The architect then partitions the route into Server Components (data) and Client Components (interactivity), placing Suspense at the boundaries where streaming improves perceived performance.

Cache decisions follow a strict matrix: is the data user-specific or global? Is it mutated by user action or by external systems? Is freshness critical or eventually consistent acceptable? Each cell of the matrix maps to a specific combination of `cache`, `revalidate`, and tag-based invalidation.

The architect then validates the route against the production gates: does it pass Core Web Vitals on throttled 4G? Does it stream without layout shift? Does it degrade gracefully when a downstream service fails? Does it cost proportionally to its business value?

## 6. Decision Making Rules

- When Server Components and Client Components conflict, choose Server Components because less JavaScript ships to the user.
- When `fetch` cache and explicit invalidation conflict, choose tag-based invalidation because it is precise and survives refactors.
- When Edge and Node runtimes conflict, choose Node for heavy I/O and Edge for latency-sensitive middleware because Edge cold starts are negligible.
- When SSG and SSR conflict, choose SSG with ISR when content changes are predictable because static is always faster.
- When `loading.tsx` and inline Suspense conflict, choose inline Suspense when only part of the route streams because `loading.tsx` replaces the whole segment.
- When Server Actions and Route Handlers conflict, choose Server Actions for form-driven mutations because they enable progressive enhancement.
- When parallel routes and conditional rendering conflict, choose parallel routes for slot composition because they preserve URL state.
- When middleware and route handlers conflict, choose middleware for cross-cutting checks (auth, locale) because it runs before the route resolves.
- When `generateStaticParams` and on-demand ISR conflict, choose `generateStaticParams` for known paths and on-demand for the long tail because prerender cost is bounded.
- When PPR and full SSR conflict, choose PPR when a route has both static shell and dynamic fragments because it combines the best of both.

## 7. Architecture Rules

- Always colocate route files; never import page components across route boundaries.
- Always place `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` per route segment that streams or can fail.
- Always define `not-found.tsx` at the root and per dynamic segment that may 404.
- Always use route groups to organize features without polluting the URL.
- Always keep middleware under 1 MB bundle and free of Node APIs.
- Always tag every cached `fetch` with at least one revalidation tag.
- Always mark server-only modules with `import 'server-only'`.
- Always isolate client state in `'use client'` components that are as leaf as possible.
- Always render metadata via the Metadata API; never inject `<title>` or `<meta>` manually.
- Always configure `runtime` per route segment when it matters; never rely on the default for hot paths.

## 8. Coding Standards

- Always use TypeScript with `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, and `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
- Always export route handlers as named HTTP methods; never export default.
- Always type Server Action arguments with Zod and never trust the client.
- Always return serializable data from Server Actions; never return class instances or Dates without serialization.
- Always use `next/image` for raster images; never use raw `<img>` for content images.
- Always use `next/font` for fonts; never use `@import` in CSS for fonts.
- Always use `next/link` for internal navigation; never use `<a>` alone.
- Always prefer `Promise.all` for parallel data fetching over sequential `await`.
- Always name route files in lowercase: `page.tsx`, not `Page.tsx`.
- Always export `metadata` or `generateMetadata` from every public page.
- Always configure `dynamic`, `revalidate`, and `runtime` at the segment level when non-default.

## 9. Naming Conventions

- Route files: lowercase (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`).
- Route groups: `kebab-case` in parentheses (`(dashboard)`, `(marketing)`).
- Parallel routes: `@kebab-case` (`@modal`, `@sidebar`).
- Intercepting routes: `(.)`, `(..)`, `(...)` followed by the segment name.
- Dynamic segments: `[camelCase]` (`[userId]`, `[slug]`).
- Catch-all segments: `[...slug]`; optional catch-all: `[[...slug]]`.
- Server Action files: `actions.ts` colocated in the feature; exported functions suffixed with `Action` (`signInAction`).
- Route handlers: `route.ts` in a folder named after the resource (`app/api/users/route.ts`).
- Middleware: `middleware.ts` at the project root or `src/`.
- Instrumentation: `instrumentation.ts` at the project root.
- Components: PascalCase (`UserCard`).
- Hooks: `use<Feature>` camelCase.
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
- Types: PascalCase without `I` prefix.

## 12. Design Patterns

### Server Component Data Container
When to use: any page that fetches data and renders it. When not to use: pages that are pure client interactivity. Sketch: `page.tsx` is `async`, fetches, and renders Server Components; passes serializable props to Client Components.

### Parallel Route Modal
When to use: modals that should be deep-linkable. When not to use: ephemeral toasts. Sketch: `@modal/(.)photo/[id]/page.tsx` intercepts `/photo/[id]` and renders the modal; the un-intercepted route renders the full page.

### Tag-based Revalidation
When to use: any mutation that affects cached data. When not to use: user-specific data that should never be cached. Sketch: `fetch(url, { next: { tags: ['posts'] } })` paired with `revalidateTag('posts')` in the Server Action.

### Streaming with Suspense
When to use: routes with mixed fast and slow data. When not to use: routes where all data is instant. Sketch: static shell renders immediately, `<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>` wraps the slow async component.

### Server Action Form
When to use: any mutation triggered by a user. When not to use: read-only interactions. Sketch: `<form action={createPostAction}>` with `useFormStatus` for the button; no client-side fetch needed.

### Route Handler Webhook
When to use: receiving third-party webhooks. When not to use: internal APIs (prefer Server Actions). Sketch: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` exports `POST`, verifies the signature, processes the event, returns 200.

### Edge Middleware Auth Gate
When to use: auth checks that must run before every protected route. When not to use: heavy database work. Sketch: `middleware.ts` reads the session cookie, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.

## 13. Best Practices

- Always default to Server Components; mark `'use client'` only for interactivity.
- Always tag cached `fetch` calls and pair them with explicit `revalidateTag` calls in mutations.
- Always stream slow data with Suspense and a meaningful skeleton.
- Always set `metadataBase` to enable correct absolute URLs for OpenGraph.
- Always generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` via the App Router.
- Always use `next/image` with explicit `width` and `height` to prevent layout shift.
- Always preload the LCP image with `priority` on the `Image` component.
- Always set `export const runtime = 'nodejs' | 'edge'` per route when the default is suboptimal.
- Always validate environment variables with Zod at boot.
- Always configure CSP, HSTS, and `X-Content-Type-Options` in `next.config.ts`.
- Always use `output: 'standalone'` for Docker deployments.
- Always run `next build` in CI and fail on warnings.

## 14. Anti Patterns

### Anti-pattern: `fetch` without cache tags
Why wrong: cannot be invalidated precisely; leads to stale data or origin collapse. Correct alternative: always pass `next: { tags: [...] }`.

### Anti-pattern: Client Components fetching data
Why wrong: ships JavaScript, breaks SSR, loses caching. Correct alternative: fetch in a Server Component and pass serializable props.

### Anti-pattern: Using `useEffect` to fetch in App Router pages
Why wrong: bypasses streaming, causes waterfalls, breaks back/forward cache. Correct alternative: fetch in the Server Component or use `use` with Suspense.

### Anti-pattern: Manual `<title>` tags in JSX
Why wrong: duplicates Metadata API, breaks streaming metadata. Correct alternative: export `metadata` or `generateMetadata`.

### Anti-pattern: Storing auth state in `localStorage`
Why wrong: inaccessible to Server Components, vulnerable to XSS. Correct alternative: HttpOnly cookies read by middleware or Server Components.

### Anti-pattern: Heavy logic in middleware
Why wrong: middleware runs on every request on the Edge; bundle size and runtime constraints apply. Correct alternative: do heavy work in route handlers or Server Components.

## 15. Performance Rules

- Always set `dynamic = 'force-static'` or `revalidate` on routes that can be prerendered.
- Always prefetch critical routes with `<Link prefetch>`.
- Always defer non-critical images with `loading="lazy"`.
- Always set `fetchpriority="high"` on the LCP image.
- Always minify and tree-shake; never ship unused dependencies.
- Always use `next/font` with `display: swap` and preload.
- Always configure `images.formats` to include `image/avif` and `image/webp`.
- Always measure route bundle size in CI and alert on regressions.

## 16. Security Rules

- Always validate Server Action inputs with Zod.
- Always authorize inside the Action, not only in middleware.
- Always verify webhook signatures in Route Handlers.
- Always set `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` on auth cookies.
- Always enforce CSP with nonces for scripts.
- Always escape dynamic content in URLs to prevent open redirects.
- Always rate-limit auth and mutation endpoints.
- Never expose secrets to the client; prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only when intentionally public.

## 17. Testing Strategy

- Always test Server Actions through their public function signature with mocked data layer.
- Always test route handlers with `GET`/`POST` invocation against in-memory fixtures.
- Always test middleware redirect logic with a request stub.
- Always test the four states (idle, pending, success, error) for interactive components.
- Always mock `fetch` and external APIs with MSW.
- Always run Playwright E2E tests against a production build.
- Always test `generateMetadata` returns correct absolute URLs.
- Always test `generateStaticParams` covers the expected paths.
- Always assert that cached `fetch` calls include the expected tags.
- Always verify `not-found.tsx` renders for unknown dynamic segments.

## 18. Documentation Standards

- Every route directory ships a `README.md` describing its purpose, cache profile, and runtime.
- Every Server Action is documented with its input schema, authorization, and revalidation effects.
- Every environment variable is documented in `.env.example` with its purpose and consumer.
- Every middleware rule is documented with the matcher and the redirect target.
- ADRs record cache strategy, runtime selection, and deployment target decisions.
- The `docs/` folder includes a deployment runbook and a rollback procedure.
- `CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog and is updated per PR.
- Every breaking change includes a migration guide.

- Always handle revalidation failures with retry and exponential backoff.
- Always validate error shape with a type guard before rendering.
- Always include a "contact support" affordance with a `traceId`.

## 26. Examples

### Example 1: Tagged fetch with on-demand revalidation

```ts
// src/features/posts/api.ts
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';
import 'server-only';

export async function getPosts(): Promise<Post[]> {
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/posts`, {
    next: { tags: ['posts'], revalidate: 60 },
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch posts');
  return res.json();
}

export async function createPost(input: NewPost): Promise<Post> {
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/posts`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(input),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to create post');
  revalidateTag('posts');
  return res.json();
}
```

### Example 2: Server Action with Zod validation

```ts
// src/features/posts/actions.ts
'use server';
import { z } from 'zod';

const Schema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(3).max(120),
  body: z.string().min(10),
});

export async function createPostAction(prev: State, formData: FormData): Promise<State> {
  const parsed = Schema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(formData));
  if (!parsed.success) {
    return { status: 'error', issues: parsed.error.flatten().fieldErrors };
  }
  await requireUser();
  await createPost(parsed.data);
  return { status: 'success' };
}
```

### Example 3: Parallel route modal with interception

```tsx
// src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/@modal/(.)photo/[id]/page.tsx
import { Modal } from '@/components/modal';
import { getPhoto } from '@/features/photos/api';

export default async function PhotoModal({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await params;
  const photo = await getPhoto(id);
  return (
    <Modal>
      <img src={photo.url} alt={photo.alt} />
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

## 27. Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Forgetting `await params` in Next.js 15
What: accessing `params.id` synchronously. Why wrong: `params` is a Promise in Next.js 15; synchronous access returns `undefined`. How to avoid: always `const { id } = await params`.

### Mistake: Untagged `fetch` calls
What: `fetch(url)` with no `next.tags`. Why wrong: cannot be invalidated; stale data forever. How to avoid: always pass `next: { tags: [...] }`.

### Mistake: `'use client'` at the top of every file
What: marking everything as client. Why wrong: ships megabytes of JavaScript. How to avoid: default to Server Component; mark client only when needed.

### Mistake: Manual `<title>` tags
What: `<title>...</title>` in JSX. Why wrong: conflicts with Metadata API. How to avoid: export `metadata` or `generateMetadata`.

### Mistake: Storing auth tokens in `localStorage`
What: persisting JWTs in the browser. Why wrong: XSS exfiltration risk; Server Components cannot read it. How to avoid: use HttpOnly cookies.

### Mistake: Heavy database calls in middleware
What: querying the database from `middleware.ts`. Why wrong: Edge runtime has no Node APIs; latency on every request. How to avoid: do auth checks in middleware, business logic in route handlers or Server Components.

### Mistake: Missing `error.tsx` for streaming routes
What: a Suspense boundary with no error boundary. Why wrong: unhandled promise rejections crash the route. How to avoid: always pair `Suspense` with `error.tsx` or an inline `ErrorBoundary`.

## 28. Professional Workflow

1. Read the product spec and identify routes, dynamic segments, and cache profile.
2. Sketch the route tree on paper; mark Server vs Client Components and Suspense boundaries.
3. Define the data layer: tagged fetches, revalidation tags, and mutation Actions.
4. Write the Zod schemas and types first; commit for review.
5. Implement the Server Components and Server Actions.
6. Add Client Components for interactivity at the leaves.
7. Add `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` per segment.
8. Configure `metadata` and `generateMetadata`.
9. Write unit tests for Actions and handlers; integration tests with MSW.
10. Add Playwright E2E for the critical user flow.
