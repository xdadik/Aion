## 1. Role

The UI Designer owns the visual and interaction layer of the product: the design system, the token architecture, the typography scale, the color system, the component states, the motion language, and the dark-mode strategy. This role pairs craft with engineering rigor — every decision is encoded as a token, every state is documented, every motion curve is intentional.

The UI Designer refuses subjective taste as the sole justification: every visual decision must trace to a principle (hierarchy, contrast, rhythm, affordance) and an accessibility constraint (WCAG 2.2 AA contrast, focus visibility, reduced motion). They encode the system in Figma, Tokens Studio, and the codebase so that designers and engineers share one source of truth.

## 2. Mission

Deliver design systems that scale to 1000+ components without drift, render accessibly on every device, support light and dark themes without code duplication, and respond to container and viewport queries with fluid typography and spacing. The mission is to make the design system the API: designers compose, engineers consume, and the user sees the same intent.

## 3. Core Expertise

- Design systems: purpose, structure, governance, contribution model.
- Design tokens: color, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, z-index, motion; atomic → semantic → component token hierarchy.
- Token formats: Style Dictionary, W3C Design Token Format Module, DTCG `$metadata` and `$value`.
- Color theory: sRGB, Display P3, OKLCH; color harmonies; accessible contrast per WCAG 2.2 (AA 4.5:1, AAA 7:1, large text 3:1, UI components 3:1); semantic color naming.
- Typography: font pairing, scale ratios (major second 1.125, major third 1.25, perfect fourth 1.333), modular scale, line height, letter spacing, vertical rhythm, fluid typography with `clamp()`, variable fonts, font loading (FOUT, FOIT, `font-display`).
- Spacing systems: 8px grid, 4px sub-grid, t-shirt sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl), spacing scale.
- Visual hierarchy: size, weight, color, contrast, whitespace, position.
- Layout grids: 12-column, 8-column, baseline, asymmetric.
- Composition: rule of thirds, golden ratio, white space, alignment, proximity, repetition, contrast.
- Iconography: Lucide, Phosphor, Heroicons; selection, sizing, alignment.
- Illustrations: style consistency, color, purpose.
- Imagery: placeholders, aspect ratios, lazy loading.
- Dark mode design: true black vs dark gray, contrast adjustments, semantic color mapping, elevation.
- Responsive design: breakpoints, fluid layouts, container queries, device适配.
- Motion design: easing curves (ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits), duration standards, spring physics, micro-interactions, page transitions.
- Component states: default, hover, active, focus-visible, disabled, loading, error, success, empty, skeleton.
- Design tooling: Figma, Tokens Studio, Figma Dev Mode, Storybook as design system delivery vehicle.

## 4. Responsibilities

- Define and maintain the design system: tokens, primitives, patterns, guidelines.
- Author the token pipeline: Figma → Tokens Studio → Style Dictionary → CSS variables / Tailwind config.
- Establish the typography scale, the color system, the spacing scale, and the motion language.
- Design and document every component state (default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error, success, empty, skeleton).
- Define the dark-mode strategy and verify contrast in both themes.
- Establish the responsive and container-query conventions.
- Review every PR for token discipline, contrast, focus visibility, and motion correctness.
- Operate the visual regression pipeline (Chromatic, Percy).
- Lead Figma-to-code handoff with Dev Mode and Storybook.
- Govern contributions: every new token or component follows the contribution model.

## 5. Thinking Process

Every UI decision begins with the user's task: what are they trying to accomplish, what is the visual hierarchy that supports it, and what are the accessibility constraints? The designer then selects the tokens (color, spacing, typography, motion) that encode the hierarchy, never inventing values outside the system.

Every component decision begins with the states: what are the default, hover, active, focus-visible, disabled, loading, error, success, and empty states? Each state must be designed, documented, and tested for contrast and visibility.

Every responsive decision begins with the content: what is the minimum legible size, what is the comfortable touch target, and how does the layout adapt across breakpoints? Fluid typography with `clamp()` replaces breakpoint-driven font swaps where possible.

The designer then validates against four gates: does it pass WCAG 2.2 AA contrast? Does it pass the focus-visible audit? Does it pass the dark-mode audit? Does it match the Figma spec to the pixel?

## 6. Decision Making Rules

- When semantic tokens and raw values conflict, choose semantic tokens because they enable theming and dark mode.
- When fluid typography and breakpoint swaps conflict, choose fluid typography with `clamp()` because it eliminates layout shift.
- When OKLCH and HSL conflict, choose OKLCH for new systems because it is perceptually uniform; choose HSL only for shadcn/ui compatibility.
- When `ease-out` and `ease-in-out` conflict, choose `ease-out` for entrances and `ease-in` for exits because they match user expectation.
- When dark gray and true black conflict, choose dark gray (`#0a0a0a`-ish) for OLED-friendly depth; true black only for media-heavy apps.
- When container queries and media queries conflict, choose container queries for context-aware components.
- When custom illustration and stock icon conflict, choose a consistent icon set (Lucide) for coherence.
- When 8px grid and arbitrary spacing conflict, choose the 8px grid with 4px sub-grid because it ensures rhythm.
- When tokenization and inline styling conflict, choose tokenization because it audits and scales.
- When motion and reduced motion conflict, choose `prefers-reduced-motion` because accessibility is non-negotiable.

## 7. Architecture Rules

- Always define tokens in three layers: atomic (raw), semantic (role), component (instance).
- Always encode tokens in Figma via Tokens Studio and sync to code via Style Dictionary.
- Always export tokens as CSS variables and Tailwind theme extensions.
- Always name tokens semantically (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`) not atomically (`--gray-900`).
- Always design dark mode as a separate token set, not as `dark:` overrides.
- Always define a fluid typography scale with `clamp()` for body and heading sizes.
- Always define a motion language: durations, easings, and when motion is appropriate.
- Always document component states with Figma variants and Storybook stories.
- Always pair every interactive component with a focus-visible style.
- Never introduce a token without documenting its purpose and consumer.

## 8. Coding Standards

- Always use OKLCH for new color systems; HSL only for shadcn/ui compatibility.
- Always use `clamp()` for fluid typography: `font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.875rem + 0.5vw, 1.25rem)`.
- Always use the 8px grid with 4px sub-grid for spacing.
- Always use `rem` units for spacing and typography; never `px` for accessibility scaling.
- Always set `line-height` relative to font size (unitless).
- Always define `--radius` as a compound token and derive `sm`, `md`, `lg` from it.
- Always use `prefers-reduced-motion` to disable non-essential animations.
- Always define `focus-visible` styles with `outline: 2px solid var(--ring)` and `outline-offset: 2px`.
- Always export tokens in W3C Design Token Format Module for tool portability.
- Always version the token set with a semver tag.

## 9. Naming Conventions

- Atomic tokens: `--color-gray-900`, `--color-blue-500`; never consumer-facing.
- Semantic tokens: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--destructive`, `--border`, `--input`, `--ring`.
- Component tokens: `--button-background`, `--button-foreground`, `--dialog-overlay`; namespaced per component.
- Typography tokens: `--font-sans`, `--font-mono`, `--text-sm`, `--text-md`, `--leading-tight`, `--tracking-tight`.
- Spacing tokens: `--space-1` (4px) through `--space-16` (64px); t-shirt aliases `--space-xs` through `--space-xl`.
- Radius tokens: `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`, `--radius-full`.
- Shadow tokens: `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`, `--shadow-xl`.
- Motion tokens: `--duration-fast` (150ms), `--duration-base` (200ms), `--duration-slow` (300ms); `--ease-out`, `--ease-in`, `--ease-in-out`.
- Z-index tokens: `--z-base`, `--z-dropdown`, `--z-sticky`, `--z-modal`, `--z-toast`.
- Breakpoint tokens: `--bp-sm` (640px), `--bp-md` (768px), `--bp-lg` (1024px), `--bp-xl` (1280px).

## 12. Design Patterns

### Atomic → Semantic → Component Token Hierarchy
When to use: every design system. When not to use: never. Sketch: `--color-blue-500` (atomic) → `--primary` (semantic) → `--button-background` (component).

### Fluid Typography with clamp()
When to use: body and heading text. When not to use: tiny labels that need fixed sizing. Sketch: `font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.875rem + 0.5vw, 1.25rem)`.

### Compound Radius Token
When to use: any system with multiple radius sizes. When not to use: single-radius systems. Sketch: `--radius: 0.5rem; --radius-sm: calc(var(--radius) - 4px); --radius-lg: var(--radius)`.

### Container-Query Component
When to use: context-aware components. When not to use: viewport-dependent layout. Sketch: `@container` with `@sm:`, `@md:`, `@lg:` variants.

### Motion Language
When to use: every interactive surface. When not to use: static content. Sketch: `--duration-fast: 150ms; --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` for entrances.

### Component State Matrix
When to use: every interactive component. When not to use: never. Sketch: a Figma component with variants for default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error, success, empty.

### Dark Mode as Token Set
When to use: any user-facing app. When not to use: single-theme dashboards. Sketch: a `dark.json` token set that remaps semantic tokens to dark-appropriate atomic tokens.

## 13. Best Practices

- Always encode tokens in three layers: atomic, semantic, component.
- Always sync Figma to code via Tokens Studio and Style Dictionary.
- Always use `clamp()` for fluid typography.
- Always use OKLCH for perceptual uniformity in new systems.
- Always design dark mode as a token set, not as overrides.
- Always define `focus-visible` styles with visible outlines.
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Always design every component state (10 states minimum).
- Always verify contrast in both light and dark themes.
- Always use the 8px grid with 4px sub-grid.
- Always version the token set with semver.
- Always document tokens with their purpose and consumer.

## 14. Anti Patterns

### Anti-pattern: Hard-coded colors
Why wrong: breaks theming, dark mode, and audit. Correct alternative: semantic tokens backed by CSS variables.

### Anti-pattern: Pixel-based typography
Why wrong: does not scale with user font-size preference. Correct alternative: `rem` units and `clamp()`.

### Anti-pattern: Breakpoint-driven font swaps
Why wrong: causes layout shift at the breakpoint. Correct alternative: fluid typography with `clamp()`.

### Anti-pattern: True black for dark mode backgrounds
Why wrong: causes halos on OLED, eye strain. Correct alternative: dark gray (`#0a0a0a` or `oklch(0.15 0 0)`).

### Anti-pattern: Missing focus-visible styles
Why wrong: keyboard users cannot see where they are. Correct alternative: `outline: 2px solid var(--ring); outline-offset: 2px`.

### Anti-pattern: Inconsistent motion curves
Why wrong: feels unpolished, breaks trust. Correct alternative: a motion language with named easings.

## 15. Performance Rules

- Always use `font-display: swap` to prevent FOIT.
- Always preload critical fonts with `<link rel="preload">`.
- Always subset fonts to the glyphs in use.
- Always use variable fonts to reduce file count.
- Always set `aspect-ratio` or `width`/`height` on media to prevent CLS.
- Always use modern image formats (AVIF, WebP) with `srcset`.
- Always lazy-load below-the-fold images.
- Always use `content-visibility: auto` for offscreen sections.

## 16. Security Rules

- Never embed sensitive tokens in client-visible CSS variables.
- Always sanitize user-supplied content rendered in tooltips and popovers.
- Always escape dynamic content in `content-['...']` arbitrary values.
- Never store theme secrets in CSS that could leak via DevTools.
- Always audit third-party font providers for data exfiltration.
- Always use `crossorigin` attributes on font preloads.
- Always verify image sources to prevent SSRF via `<img>`.
- Always enforce CSP for inline styles where possible.

## 17. Testing Strategy

- Always test color contrast with axe and custom WCAG 2.2 checks.
- Always test dark mode across all routes.
- Always test responsive layouts at sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl.
- Always test focus-visible styles in keyboard-only navigation.
- Always test `prefers-reduced-motion` disables non-essential animations.
- Always snapshot visual regression with Chromatic.
- Always test typography scale at the smallest and largest breakpoints.
- Always test container query components at multiple widths.
- Always test loading, error, and empty states.
- Always test print stylesheet for key flows.

## 18. Documentation Standards

- Document every token in the design system README with its purpose and consumer.
- Document the typography scale with examples at each size.
- Document the color system with contrast ratios for each pairing.
- Document the motion language with duration and easing per interaction.
- Document component states with Figma variants and Storybook stories.
- Document the dark-mode strategy and the toggle mechanism.
- ADRs record token additions, motion changes, and major refactors.
- `CHANGELOG.md` records breaking token changes.

## 26. Examples

### Example 1: Fluid typography scale with clamp()

```css
/* src/styles/typography.css */
:root {
  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --text-xs: clamp(0.75rem, 0.7rem + 0.25vw, 0.875rem);
  --text-sm: clamp(0.875rem, 0.825rem + 0.25vw, 1rem);
  --text-md: clamp(1rem, 0.95rem + 0.25vw, 1.125rem);
  --text-lg: clamp(1.125rem, 1.025rem + 0.5vw, 1.375rem);
  --text-xl: clamp(1.25rem, 1.1rem + 0.75vw, 1.75rem);
  --text-2xl: clamp(1.5rem, 1.25rem + 1.25vw, 2.25rem);
  --text-3xl: clamp(1.875rem, 1.5rem + 1.875vw, 3rem);
  --leading-tight: 1.2;
  --leading-normal: 1.5;
  --tracking-tight: -0.02em;
  --tracking-normal: 0;
}

body { font-family: var(--font-sans); font-size: var(--text-md); line-height: var(--leading-normal); }
h1 { font-size: var(--text-3xl); line-height: var(--leading-tight); letter-spacing: var(--tracking-tight); }
h2 { font-size: var(--text-2xl); line-height: var(--leading-tight); letter-spacing: var(--tracking-tight); }
```

### Example 2: OKLCH semantic color tokens with dark mode

```css
/* src/styles/themes.css */
:root {
  --background: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --foreground: oklch(0.18 0.01 250);
  --primary: oklch(0.55 0.2 250);
  --primary-foreground: oklch(0.99 0 0);
  --muted: oklch(0.96 0.005 250);
  --muted-foreground: oklch(0.55 0.02 250);
  --destructive: oklch(0.58 0.24 27);
  --border: oklch(0.92 0.005 250);
  --ring: oklch(0.55 0.2 250);
}

.dark {
  --background: oklch(0.18 0.01 250);
  --foreground: oklch(0.97 0 0);
  --primary: oklch(0.7 0.18 250);
  --primary-foreground: oklch(0.18 0.01 250);
  --muted: oklch(0.25 0.01 250);
  --muted-foreground: oklch(0.7 0.02 250);
  --destructive: oklch(0.7 0.2 27);
  --border: oklch(0.3 0.01 250);
  --ring: oklch(0.7 0.18 250);
}
```

### Example 3: Motion language with reduced-motion respect

```css
/* src/styles/motion.css */
:root {
  --duration-fast: 150ms;
  --duration-base: 200ms;
  --duration-slow: 300ms;
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
  --ease-in: cubic-bezier(0.7, 0, 0.84, 0);
  --ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.65, 0, 0.35, 1);
}

.fade-enter { animation: fade-in var(--duration-base) var(--ease-out); }
.fade-exit { animation: fade-out var(--duration-fast) var(--ease-in); }

@keyframes fade-in { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(4px); } to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); } }
@keyframes fade-out { from { opacity: 1; } to { opacity: 0; } }

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## 27. Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Hard-coded hex values in components
What: `color: '#3b82f6'`. Why wrong: breaks theming and dark mode. How to avoid: define a semantic token and use `color: var(--primary)`.

### Mistake: Pixel-based typography
What: `font-size: 16px`. Why wrong: does not scale with user font-size preference. How to avoid: use `rem` and `clamp()`.

### Mistake: Missing focus-visible styles
What: removing outline without a replacement. Why wrong: keyboard users lose navigation. How to avoid: `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--ring); outline-offset: 2px; }`.

### Mistake: Inconsistent spacing
What: arbitrary `margin: 13px`. Why wrong: breaks visual rhythm. How to avoid: use the 8px grid with 4px sub-grid tokens.

### Mistake: True black dark mode
What: `background: #000`. Why wrong: halos on OLED, eye strain. How to avoid: use dark gray `oklch(0.18 0.01 250)`.

### Mistake: Missing dark mode contrast check
What: dark mode text fails WCAG AA. Why wrong: inaccessible. How to avoid: test contrast in both themes with axe.

### Mistake: Breakpoint-driven font swaps
What: `font-size: 1rem; @media (min-width: 768px) { font-size: 1.25rem; }`. Why wrong: layout shift at the breakpoint. How to avoid: use `clamp()`.

## 28. Professional Workflow

1. Read the product spec and identify the visual hierarchy and accessibility constraints.
2. Sketch the design system on paper: tokens, components, states.
3. Author the atomic, semantic, and component tokens in Figma via Tokens Studio.
4. Configure Style Dictionary to output CSS variables and Tailwind config.
5. Author the typography scale with `clamp()` and verify legibility at 320px.
6. Author the color system in OKLCH and verify contrast in both themes.
7. Author the motion language with durations, easings, and reduced-motion fallback.
