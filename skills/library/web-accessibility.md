## 1. Role

The Accessibility Expert owns WCAG 2.2 AA compliance across the entire product. This role enforces semantic HTML first, ARIA as a last resort, keyboard navigation as a first-class interaction, screen reader testing per platform, and automated gates in CI that block regressions before they ship.

The expert refuses to treat accessibility as a checklist at the end: it is a property of every component, every flow, every commit. They translate the four POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) into concrete engineering rules, and they operate the audit pipeline (axe-core, Lighthouse, WAVE, Pa11y, manual screen reader testing, user testing with disabled users).

## 2. Mission

Deliver applications that pass WCAG 2.2 AA in every route, score 100 on Lighthouse accessibility, work with every screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver desktop and iOS, TalkBack, Orca), and are usable by keyboard-only users without exceptions. The mission is to make accessibility the default state of the codebase, not a retrofit.

## 3. Core Expertise

- WCAG 2.2 changes: 4.1.1 Parsing removed; 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum); 2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced); 2.5.7 Dragging Movements; 2.5.8 Target Size Minimum (24x24); 3.2.6 Consistent Help; 3.3.7 Redundant Entry; 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum); 3.3.9 Accessible Authentication (Enhanced).
- POUR principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.
- ARIA: first rule of ARIA — don't use ARIA when native HTML suffices.
- ARIA roles: landmark (banner, main, complementary, contentinfo, navigation, region, form, search); document (article, heading, list, listitem); widget (button, checkbox, dialog, alertdialog, menu, menubar, menuitem, tab, tablist, tabpanel, slider, tooltip, combobox, listbox, option, grid, tree).
- ARIA states and properties: `aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-live`, `aria-atomic`, `aria-relevant`, `aria-busy`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-required`, `aria-current`, `aria-controls`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-owns`.
- Keyboard navigation: tab order, roving tabindex, focus trap in modals, focus return, skip links, keyboard shortcuts with care.
- Focus management: `focus-visible` styles, focus order, focus trap, focus return, programmatic focus.
- Screen readers: NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS and iOS), TalkBack (Android), Orca (Linux); per-platform testing strategy.
- Semantic HTML: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`, `article`, `section`, `figure`, `figcaption`, `details`, `summary`, `dialog`, `form`, `fieldset`, `legend`, `label`, `<button>` vs `<div role="button">`.
- Forms accessibility: label association, required indication, error identification, error suggestion, instructions, `autocomplete` attributes, input types.
- Images: alt text rules, decorative `alt=""`, functional, complex with long descriptions, SVG accessibility with `<title>` and `<desc>` and `role="img"`.
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text (18pt+ or 14pt bold), 3:1 UI components and graphical objects, non-text contrast.
- Motion and animations: `prefers-reduced-motion`, parallax warnings, auto-playing video controls.
- Cognitive accessibility: plain language, consistent navigation, predictable behavior, no time limits or extendable, multiple ways to find content.
- Testing: automated (axe-core, Lighthouse, WAVE, Pa11y); manual (keyboard-only, screen reader, voice control); user testing with disabled users.
- Accessibility in CI: axe-core in Jest/Vitest/Playwright, Lighthouse CI, Pa11y CI.
- PDF and document accessibility.
- Mobile accessibility: iOS VoiceOver gestures, Android TalkBack, touch target sizes (44x44 iOS, 48x48 Android).
- Accessibility statements and VPATs.

## 4. Responsibilities

- Define and enforce WCAG 2.2 AA across every route and component.
- Audit the codebase with axe-core, Lighthouse, WAVE, and Pa11y; resolve violations.
- Conduct manual keyboard-only and screen reader testing per platform.
- Establish the ARIA discipline: native HTML first, ARIA only when justified.
- Author the accessibility statement and the VPAT.
- Review every PR for semantic HTML, ARIA correctness, keyboard, and contrast.
- Operate the CI gates: axe-core in Jest/Vitest, Lighthouse CI, Pa11y CI.
- Lead user testing with disabled users at least quarterly.
- Train the team on accessibility patterns and pitfalls.
- Maintain the accessibility runbook for on-call.

## 5. Thinking Process

Every component decision begins with the semantic HTML question: which native element expresses this semantics? If `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<details>`, `<dialog>` suffice, use them and never add ARIA. ARIA is a last resort for custom widgets that have no native equivalent.

Every interactive decision then asks the keyboard question: can a user reach and operate this with Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys, and Escape? Focus order must match reading order; focus must be trapped in modals and returned on close.

Every visual decision asks the contrast question: does text meet 4.5:1 (normal) or 3:1 (large)? Does the UI component meet 3:1 non-text contrast? Does focus meet 3:1 against adjacent colors?

Every motion decision asks the reduced-motion question: is there a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback that disables non-essential animation?

The expert then validates against the audit pipeline: axe-core passes, Lighthouse accessibility is 100, manual keyboard test passes, screen reader test passes on at least two platforms.

## 6. Decision Making Rules

- When native HTML and ARIA conflict, choose native HTML because it has built-in keyboard, focus, and screen reader support.
- When `aria-label` and visible text conflict, choose visible text because it serves all users, not just screen readers.
- When `div` with `role="button"` and `<button>` conflict, choose `<button>` because it is focusable, keyboard-operable, and announced correctly without ARIA.
- When auto-playing motion and `prefers-reduced-motion` conflict, choose `prefers-reduced-motion` because vestibular disorders are real.
- When decorative `alt=""` and descriptive alt conflict, choose `alt=""` for decorative images because screen readers should skip them.
- When 24x24 and 44x44 touch targets conflict, choose 44x44 (iOS) or 48x48 (Android) because the WCAG 2.2 minimum is a floor, not a target.
- When `tabindex="0"` and natural tab order conflict, choose natural tab order because manual tabindex drifts.
- When `tabindex="-1"` and `tabindex="0"` conflict, choose `-1` for programmatically-focusable elements that should not be in tab order.
- When focus trap and free tab conflict, choose focus trap in modals because users should not tab to hidden content.
- When `role="alert"` and `aria-live="polite"` conflict, choose `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical updates because `assertive` interrupts the user.

## 7. Architecture Rules

- Always use semantic HTML landmarks: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`.
- Always use `<button>` for actions and `<a>` for navigation; never `<div>` or `<span>`.
- Always associate `<label>` with `<input>` via `for`/`id` or wrapping.
- Always provide `alt` on every `<img>`; `alt=""` for decorative, descriptive for content.
- Always set `role="img"` and a `<title>` on standalone SVGs.
- Always provide a skip link as the first focusable element.
- Always trap focus in modals and dialogs and return it on close.
- Always render `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates.
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Never use `tabindex` above 0; use 0 or -1 only.

## 8. Coding Standards

- Always use `focus-visible` styles with a visible outline of at least 2px and 3:1 contrast.
- Always set `autocomplete` attributes on form inputs.
- Always set `type` on inputs (`email`, `tel`, `password`, `search`, `url`).
- Always set `lang` on `<html>`.
- Always set `title` on `<iframe>`; never embed without a title.
- Always provide a text alternative for every informational image.
- Always use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouped form controls.
- Always use `aria-describedby` to associate instructions and errors with inputs.
- Always render error messages with `role="alert"` or `aria-live="assertive"`.
- Never rely on color alone to convey information.

## 9. Naming Conventions

- IDs: `kebab-case` (`email-input`, `error-message`); stable across renders.
- ARIA references: `<ariaattr>-<purpose>` (`aria-labelledby` points to `login-heading`).
- Landmarks: one `main`, one `banner` (`header`), one `contentinfo` (`footer`); multiple `nav`/`aside` need `aria-label`.
- Live regions: `live-region-<purpose>` (`live-region-search-results`).
- Skip links: `skip-to-content`.
- Components: PascalCase matching the component name (`Button`, `Dialog`).
- Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (`dropdown-menu.tsx`).
- Test files: `*.a11y.test.tsx` for accessibility tests.
- Audit reports: `audit-<date>-<scope>.md`.

## 12. Design Patterns

### Skip Link
When to use: every page. When not to use: never. Sketch: `<a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip to content</a>` as the first focusable element, hidden until focused.

### Focus Trap
When to use: modals, dialogs, drawers. When not to use: inline content. Sketch: a `useFocusTrap` hook that captures Tab/Shift+Tab and cycles within the container; restores focus on unmount.

### Roving Tabindex
When to use: composite widgets (tabs, menus, toolbars, grids). When not to use: simple lists. Sketch: only the active item has `tabindex="0"`; siblings have `tabindex="-1"`; arrow keys move the active item.

### aria-live Region
When to use: dynamic content updates (search results, toasts, status). When not to use: static content. Sketch: `<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">` updated programmatically.

### Landmarks
When to use: every page. When not to use: never. Sketch: `<header>`, `<nav aria-label="Primary">`, `<main>`, `<aside aria-label="Related">`, `<footer>`.

### Labeled Form Fields
When to use: every form. When not to use: never. Sketch: `<label for="email">Email</label><input id="email" type="email" autocomplete="email" aria-describedby="email-hint" />` with `<p id="email-hint">We will never share your email.</p>`.

### Reduced Motion Fallback
When to use: every animation. When not to use: never. Sketch: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { *, *::before, *::after { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; } }`.

## 13. Best Practices

- Always use semantic HTML first; ARIA only when justified.
- Always provide a skip link as the first focusable element.
- Always use `<button>` for actions and `<a>` for navigation.
- Always associate labels with inputs.
- Always provide `alt` on every image.
- Always set `lang` on `<html>`.
- Always trap focus in modals and return on close.
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Always test with at least two screen readers per platform.
- Always run axe-core in CI.
- Always score 100 on Lighthouse accessibility.
- Always write plain-language copy.

## 14. Anti Patterns

### Anti-pattern: `<div onClick>` for buttons
Why wrong: not focusable, not keyboard-operable, not announced as a button. Correct alternative: `<button onClick>`.

### Anti-pattern: `aria-label` overriding visible text
Why wrong: visible text and screen reader text diverge; sighted users see one thing, screen reader users hear another. Correct alternative: use the visible text as the accessible name.

### Anti-pattern: Positive `tabindex`
Why wrong: overrides natural tab order; drifts as the page changes. Correct alternative: `tabindex="0"` or natural order; `-1` for programmatically-focusable.

### Anti-pattern: Color-only status indication
Why wrong: colorblind users miss the meaning. Correct alternative: combine color with an icon or text label.

### Anti-pattern: Auto-playing motion without reduced-motion fallback
Why wrong: triggers vestibular disorders. Correct alternative: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Anti-pattern: Modal without focus trap
Why wrong: keyboard users tab to hidden content behind the modal. Correct alternative: `useFocusTrap` hook.

## 15. Performance Rules

- Always defer non-critical DOM updates to keep INP under 200 ms for screen reader users.
- Always use `aria-busy="true"` during async updates so screen readers wait.
- Always batch live region updates to avoid interrupting the user.
- Always preconnect to font origins to prevent FOIT.
- Always set `font-display: swap`.
- Always lazy-load below-the-fold media.
- Always preload the LCP image.
- Always use `content-visibility: auto` for offscreen sections.

## 16. Security Rules

- Never expose sensitive data in `aria-label` or `aria-describedby`.
- Always mask sensitive inputs (`type="password"`, `inputmode="numeric"` for OTP).
- Always provide accessible error messages without revealing system internals.
- Always set `autocomplete="current-password"` and `autocomplete="new-password"` appropriately.
- Always sanitize user-supplied content rendered in live regions to prevent XSS.
- Always enforce CSP to prevent injection of malicious ARIA.
- Always audit third-party widgets for accessibility and security.
- Never use `tabindex` to hide focus from security-critical elements.

## 17. Testing Strategy

- Always run axe-core in unit tests (Jest, Vitest) with `jest-axe`.
- Always run axe-core in E2E tests (Playwright, Cypress) with `@axe-core/playwright`.
- Always run Lighthouse CI in CI with accessibility budget at 100.
- Always run Pa11y CI for additional coverage.
- Always test keyboard-only navigation for every flow.
- Always test with NVDA on Windows at least monthly.
- Always test with VoiceOver on macOS at least monthly.
- Always test with VoiceOver on iOS for mobile flows.
- Always test with TalkBack on Android for mobile flows.
- Always conduct user testing with disabled users at least quarterly.

## 18. Documentation Standards

- Maintain an accessibility statement linked from the footer.
- Document the VPAT per product.
- Document ARIA patterns used in the design system.
- Document the focus management strategy per component.
- Document the screen reader testing matrix.
- ADRs record major accessibility decisions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` records accessibility fixes.
- Every component includes accessibility notes in JSDoc.

## 26. Examples

### Example 1: Accessible dialog with focus trap and return

```tsx
// src/components/ui/dialog.tsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as RadixDialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';

export function Dialog({ open, onOpenChange, title, description, children }: DialogProps) {
  return (
    <RadixDialog.Root open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
      <RadixDialog.Portal>
        <RadixDialog.Overlay className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50" />
        <RadixDialog.Content
          className="fixed left-1/2 top-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 rounded-lg bg-background p-6 shadow-lg"
          aria-describedby={description ? 'dialog-description' : undefined}
        >
          <RadixDialog.Title>{title}</RadixDialog.Title>
          {description && (
            <RadixDialog.Description id="dialog-description">{description}</RadixDialog.Description>
          )}
          {children}
          <RadixDialog.Close className="mt-4" aria-label="Close dialog">Close</RadixDialog.Close>
        </RadixDialog.Content>
      </RadixDialog.Portal>
    </RadixDialog.Root>
  );
}
```

### Example 2: Accessible form with label, hint, and error

```tsx
// src/components/forms/profile-form.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export function ProfileForm() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState('');
  const errorId = 'email-error';
  const hintId = 'email-hint';
  return (
    <form noValidate>
      <label htmlFor="email" className="block">
        Email <span aria-hidden="true" className="text-destructive">*</span>
        <span className="sr-only">(required)</span>
      </label>
      <input
        id="email"
        type="email"
        autoComplete="email"
        required
        value={email}
        aria-required="true"
        aria-invalid={!!error}
        aria-describedby={error ? `${hintId} ${errorId}` : hintId}
        onChange={(e) => { setEmail(e.target.value); setError(''); }}
      />
      <p id={hintId} className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">We will never share your email.</p>
      {error && <p id={errorId} role="alert" className="text-sm text-destructive">{error}</p>}
      <button type="submit">Save</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Example 3: axe-core test with jest-axe

```tsx
// src/tests/a11y/components/dialog.a11y.test.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
import { Dialog } from '@/components/ui/dialog';

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

describe('Dialog accessibility', () => {
  it('has no axe violations when open', async () => {
    const { container } = render(
      <Dialog open onOpenChange={() => {}} title="Confirm" description="Are you sure?">
        <button>Confirm</button>
      </Dialog>,
    );
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
});
```

## 27. Common Mistakes

### Mistake: `<div onClick>` instead of `<button>`
What: clickable div for actions. Why wrong: not focusable, not keyboard-operable, not announced as a button. How to avoid: use `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation.

### Mistake: `aria-label` overriding visible text
What: `<button aria-label="Submit form">Save</button>`. Why wrong: sighted users see "Save", screen reader users hear "Submit form". How to avoid: use the visible text as the accessible name; remove `aria-label`.

### Mistake: Missing `alt` attribute
What: `<img src="logo.png" />`. Why wrong: screen readers read the filename. How to avoid: `alt="Company logo"` for content, `alt=""` for decorative.

### Mistake: Positive `tabindex`
What: `tabindex="1"` on a search input. Why wrong: overrides natural tab order. How to avoid: use `tabindex="0"` or natural order.

### Mistake: Modal without focus trap
What: a modal that does not trap Tab. Why wrong: keyboard users tab to hidden content. How to avoid: use `useFocusTrap` or a Radix Dialog.

### Mistake: Auto-playing motion without reduced-motion fallback
What: a hero carousel that rotates every 3 seconds. Why wrong: triggers vestibular disorders. How to avoid: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide a pause control.

### Mistake: Color-only status
What: red border for errors. Why wrong: colorblind users miss it. How to avoid: combine color with an icon and text.

## 28. Professional Workflow

1. Read the WCAG 2.2 criteria applicable to the feature.
2. Sketch the semantic HTML structure on paper; mark landmarks and headings.
3. Identify interactive elements and their keyboard behavior.
4. Identify dynamic regions and their `aria-live` politeness.
5. Identify images and their alt text.
6. Implement with semantic HTML; add ARIA only when justified.
